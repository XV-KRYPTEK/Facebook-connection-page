# hello-world
Creating my first repository...

Hi Humans!

  I'm glad you're reading this, I like coffeescript, especially in the morning at 3am when everyone's asleep. (keep this between you and me hehe)
  As mention, we're not dealing about super strenght or even inscreasing brain capacity (actually I could...) but to remain about commits change how the 'hello-world' script is made of or to mention that the 'README.md' is free to check at any time :)
